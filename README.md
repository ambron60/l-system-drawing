# Py-L-Sys

> An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">LINK</a>].

> This project is a Python-based rendering or interpretation of L-systems as per the title **The Algorithmic Beauty
of Plants** by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer.
